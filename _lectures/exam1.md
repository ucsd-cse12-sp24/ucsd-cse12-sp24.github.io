## Exam 1

_{{ page.released-on }}_

Exam 1 is is on Wednesday, April 24 during our 10am lecture in our normal lecture room.

We will be having assigned seating. If you need a left handed seat or other non-AFA accommodation, please fill out the following form (only if you need it). Sometimes we need to put right-handed students in left-handed seats so also let us know if you cannot use a left-handed seat.

Please fill out by Monday, April 22 as we will be generating the seating chart on Tuesday.

For those who have AFA exam accommodation letters, those are all done through the Triton Testing Center. Please sign up for an available time slot immediately to ensure you can find one that fits your schedule.

We do not have an answer key, we suggest working with other students in the course or go to non-busy tutoring times. You can also bring your questions to discussion.

For CSE 12, we are not allowing cheat/note sheets. Make sure to bring pen/pencil and a picture ID (student ID preferred).
